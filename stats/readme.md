# Statistics

Efforts have begun to keep track of grabber activity on months-long time scales. A minimal statistics log was created to store the tag and hash of every downloaded image. These output files (one per day) live in the stats folder and can be inspected with [index.php](index.php). 

A live view is active here: http://www.swharden.com/qrss/plus/stats/

Graphs will be created a few months from now... (written 2018-09-08)
